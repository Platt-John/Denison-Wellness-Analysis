# Denison Wellness Analysts 

## 📌 Overview
The Denison Wellness Analysts undertook a project from Denison Office of Student Life and Hoaglin Center to examine the National College Health Assessment data to bring insights to improve Denison students’ wellness. Our team's first mission is to propose which group of students and wellness areas should be prioritized for improvement. Secondly, we are expected to show correlations among different wellness characteristics and behaviors and help guide our clients to create effective approaches. Finally, our last duty is to provide an effective way for the Student Life and Hoaglin Center staff to visualize and communicate about current and future data.
We decided to take on this project because there is an urgent need to understand and address the diverse and multi-dimensional well-being challenges that Denison students face. The Denison Office of Student Life and the Denison Hoaglin Wellness Center are committed to improving student well-being by gaining a thorough understanding of the Denison NCHA data, which contains over 1 million data points about students' health. Recognizing Denison's rich diversity, with nearly 40% of its population made up of minority groups and students from diverse backgrounds, as well as affiliations such as the Athletics Department and the Centre for Belonging and Inclusion, it's critical to provide insights that cater to their specific needs. Contemporary issues, such as food insecurity affecting mental health and academic performance, or increased anxiety disorders among students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, highlight the importance of our research. 
We, the Denison Wellness Analysts, are driven to distill this vast data, shedding light on the interconnected nature of students' challenges and demographics, with the goal of paving the way for a more tailored campus wellness service.

## 🛠️ Methods
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Variable Selection, Missing value handling, Combining disparate datasets from multiple years
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Bar charts
- **Statistical Analysis:** Bar charts, ANOVA, Chi-squared Testing, T-tests
- **Predictive Modeling:** Multiple linear regression, Multiple logistic regression

## 📈 Results
To summarize important findings for each Wellness Center priority:
- **Overall Health:** Feelings of belonging on Denison’s campus noticeably vary across different races.
- **Mental Health:** A significant proportion of students at Denison intentionally harm themselves (>12% of Denison students in our 2023 data said they intentionally injured themselves within the last 12 months). 
- **Safety:** Non-binary students display higher concerns for safety during the day and at night relative to males and females at Denison. Females show higher concerns for safety at night relative to males and non-binary students at Denison. 
- **Service Use:** There are significant demands for mental health support across the Denison student population with domestic students and international students seeking psychological services more often than medical services. 
- **Finance:** A significant proportion of students at Denison are experiencing financial challenges (40.22%) with those students especially including Black, International, Hispanic, Asian, and First-Generation students.
- **Substance Use:** Varsity Athletes and Greek Life students exhibit a higher BAC level and more moderate/high cannabis risk.
- **Academics:** Hispanic, Asian, and Black students demonstrated higher levels of microaggression impact on academics than other races and ethnicities. We see these same trends for microaggression impact on academics for Non-Binary and First Gen students. 
- **Physical Health Behaviors:** Hispanic and international students get lower amounts of sleep on weeknights and consume lower amounts of fruits and vegetables relative to other ethnicities. 
- **Sexual Health:**  White, Hispanic, and Greek Life students have oral and vaginal sex more frequently than other student groups. These same groups of students use protective barriers for vaginal sex less frequently than other students. 
- **Healthy Relationships and Consent:** Non-Binary students experience heightened levels of verbal threatening, sexual touching, and stalking.

## 📌 Future Work
Following this project, a good next step would be to perform data collection, summary statistics, and analyses on the other hundreds of variables that we did not include in our data. With this, we can unveil additional findings that will be tangible to the Wellness Center.
